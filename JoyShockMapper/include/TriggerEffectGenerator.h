/**
 * Changelog
 * Revision 1: Initial
 * Revision 2: Added Apple approximated adapter factories. (This may not be correct, please test if you have access to Apple APIs.)
 *             Added Sony factories that use Sony's names.
 *             Added Raw factories for Resistance and AutomaticGun that give direct access to bit-packed region data.
 *             Added ReWASD factories that replicate reWASD effects, warts and all.
 *             Trigger enumerations now and wrapper classes static.
 *             Minor documentation fixes.
 * Revision 3: Corrected Apple factories based on new capture log tests that show only simple rounding was needed.
 * Revision 4: Added 3 new Apple factories based on documentation and capture logs.
 *             These effects are not fully confirmed and are poorly documented even in Apple's docs.
 *             Two of these new effects are similar to our existing raw effect functions.
 * Revision 5: Reorganized and renamed functions and paramaters to be more inline with Sony's API.
 *             Information on the API was exposed by Apple and now further Steamworks version 1.55.
 *             Information is offically source from Apple documentation and Steamworks via logging
 *             HID writes to device based in inputs to new Steamworks functions. Interestingly, my
 *             Raw factories now have equivilents in Sony's offical API and will also be renamed.
 *             Full change list:
 *               TriggerEffectType Enum is re-organized for clarity and comment typoes corrected
